            __html: `<p>The importance of the Benefits Administration function to HR operations and the wider enterprise has been over-simplified in the past. However, the pandemic and its aftermath have had an unparalleled level of impact on the workforce and the importance of building a positive workplace culture and experience, and hence the role of benefits leaders is becoming more strategic than ever.</p>
                <p>Empyrean sponsored Nelson Hall to conduct a research study, interviewing 100 HR & Benefits leaders on the key HR-related issues that need to be addressed as part of an organization’s corporate strategy over the next 1-2 years and the extent to which benefits operations is key to employee experience and retention. <a href="https://empyrean.com">Request a copy of the report.</a></p>
                <p>The results of that research were used to build a Benefits Maturity Assessment. Over the next few minutes, you’ll answer a series of questions that will indicate your performance relative to that of your peers. Based on your responses, we will suggest actions to help increase your impact and uplift the capability of your benefits function, including a spider chart to indicate your overall maturity as a benefits function.</p>`,
